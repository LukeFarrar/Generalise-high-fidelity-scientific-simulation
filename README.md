# Generalise-high-fidelity-scientific-simulation
To use machine learning to generalise from a small batch of simulations, to rapidly generate predictions for parameter combinations that have not yet been sampled to accelerate the production of new results, and thus be able to make predictions much more rapidly than the present.

This jupyter notebook is designed for ease of use. The global variables at the start of the notebook should be tweaked depending on the intent.
If you are wanting to see the outputs and not have to wait I would suggest putting load to true as this should give you the most recent networks and their values however this does mean you wont be able to see the plotted graphs or the error per epoch.
If you are wanting the full experience put Debug to true, save to false, load to false and Plots to true.
