# Generalise-high-fidelity-scientific-simulation
To use machine learning to generalise from a small batch of simulations, to rapidly generate predictions for parameter combinations that have not yet been sampled to accelerate the production of new results, and thus be able to make predictions much more rapidly than the present.
